Moore algorithm also preprocesses the pattern. 
Boyer Moore is a combination of the following two approaches. 
1) Bad Character Heuristic 
2) Good Suffix Heuristic 
 it uses greatest offset suggested by the two heuristics at every step.
Boyer Moore algorithm starts matching from the last character of the pattern.

Bad Character Heuristic

The idea of bad character heuristic is simple. The character of the text which doesn’t match
 with the current character of the pattern is called the Bad Character. Upon mismatch, we shift the pattern until – 
1) The mismatch becomes a match
2) Pattern P moves past the mismatched character.

Good Suffix Heuristic

Let t be substring of text T which is matched with substring of pattern P. Now we shift pattern until :
1) Another occurrence of t in P matched with t in T.
2) A prefix of P, which matches with suffix of t
3) P moves past t
